# Interactive News Globe (ING)
This is a project where we can have access to news content based on countries. Most of the news content will be based on top news. The user will get their content from the interactive visual globe. it allows user to
gain more information from the geological location and geopolitical location view. It also allows users to interact with news from a different perspective by having users interact with the globe in ways that it promotes new discoveries on part of the planet we are not familiar with.

# How to contribute
## Step 1
Create a new branch in this format:
(name)-(feature)-(version(optional))
When a new branch is created, work on the feature you will work on.
## Step 2
For every small logic that works make sure to add and commit. You can commit without pushing, you push to the remote repository until you think you are completely done with the project and is available to review.
## Step 3
Have at least two people review the code by making a pull request. When two contributors have approved, the code should be able to push to main. Assign one contributor as a moderator, and one as a key inspector, this will be explained later.
Reco:
Have one reviewer be the moderator (mod), this is the role that not just reviews but makes sure that everything is in order of how the reviewing process should work. This means that the mod make sure that the key inspector  has reviewed and run the code to make sure it works as it should. The key inspector not just reviews the code, but have to manually go to the contributor's branch, run the code, and make sure it works as the contributor that did the pull request has intended to work. The rest can just look at the code and see if there could be improvements in the code.
